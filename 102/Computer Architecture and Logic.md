# Computer Architecture and Logic

### How a computer really work?!
the informaon is represented in the computer using a ny electrical signals going on and o at mind-
boggling speeds.
There is a main four tasks, that makes the computer a thinking machine:
1. take input
* Keyboard
* music
* camera
* microphoe
* touchscreen
2. store informaon :the computer takes the informaon from memory,
2. processing : manipulate the in$ormaon using algoruthm (series of commands)
3. output the results:
depends on what a computer is designed to do; show text, videos, photos, interacve games, and give
signals to control a repot




### CPU – or Central Processing
is considered the most important component in a computer and for good reason. it handles most operations that make it function, by processing instructions and giving signals out to other components. The CPU is the main bridge between all the computer’s major parts. RAM – Random Access Memory, or RAM for short, is a computer component where data used by the operating system and software applications store data so that the CPU can process them quickly. Everything stored on RAM is lost if the computer is shut off. Depending on the applications you use, there is typically a maximum limit of RAM you will need for the computer to function properly.
