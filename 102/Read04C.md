## **How to creat a basic javascript**
* 1- Create a folder to put the example in called cOl, then start up your favorite code editor, and enter the text to the right
### note that the extension of javascript file should be .js
* 2-Get the CSS and images for this example from the website that accompanies the book: www.javascriptbook. com 
* 3-In your code editor, enter the HTML shown on the left. Save this file with the name add-content.html The HTML <script> element is used to load the JavaScript file into the page. It has an attribute called src, whose value is the path to the script you created. 
* 4-Open the HTML file in your browser. You should see that the JavaScript has added a greeting (in this case, Good Afternoon!) to the page. (These greetings are coming from the JavaScript file; they are not in the HTML file.)
* 5- Once you have tried the example in your browser, view the source code for the page. (This option is usually under the View, Tools or Develop menu of the browser.)
* 6-The source of the web page does not actually show the new element that has been added into the page; it just shows the link to the JavaScript file
* 7- Finally, try opening the HTML file, removing the src attribute from the opening <script> tag, and adding the new code shown on the left between the opening <script> tag and the closing </script> tag. The s re attribute is no longer needed because the JavaScript is in the HTML page. 
* 8-Open the HTML file in your web browser and the welcome greeting is written into the page
