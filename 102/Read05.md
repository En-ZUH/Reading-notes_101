# ***LOOPS***
## a loop is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. Programmers use loops to cycle through values, add sums of numbers, repeat functions, and many other things. ... Two of the most common types of loops are:
* while loop 
* for loop
* Do while loop
## Examples: 
* fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  for x in fruits:
    print(x)

* let i = 0;
* do {
 * i += 1;
 * console.log(i);
* } while (i < 5);
