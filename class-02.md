## HTML ##
## Headings and paragraph

Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an <h1> element is the largest, and the contents of an <h6> element is the smallest.
## The main differences between the heading and paragraphs, is the  ***Importance***.
* <h> showing layers of search engine.
* <h> can be taken by the browser as a result

## You can structure your text as:
* **Bold** by using **b** tag
* ***Italic***  by using ***i*** tag
* **sup** element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes 
* **sub** element is used to contain characters that should be subscript 
* **br** to print a new line
* **hr** to print a line
* **em** element that allows you to indicate where emphasis should be, and it's show the word in *italic*
* **blockquote** element which indicates that a block of text is a quotation
* **strong** element indicates that its content has strong importance, and it's show the word in **bold**
* **q** element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph, like "Rose"

## CSS
### CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface, by 3 ways:
* inline
* internal file
* external file
## Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
#### Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
## Basic JavaScript instruction
* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.
* Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.
* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

## LOOPS
* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
* There are three types of loop:
* for
* while
* do ... while.
