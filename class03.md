## Lists in HTML
### HTML provides three different types of lists:
     1. Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered, created with <ol> element.

     2. Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point, created with <ul> element.

     3. Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms, created with <dl> element.

        * Inside the <dl> element you will usually see pairs of <dt> and <dd> elements.
        * <dt> used to contain the term being defined( definition)
        * <dd> is used to contain the definition

### Nested Lists
#### You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list, like the example below:

## Box Dimensions
### you can specify the size of a box, using width and height attributes, using pixels.

## Borders
### Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
## Margin: 
### Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
## Padding:
### Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.
#### The padding and margin properties bhelp to add a space between various items on the page.
