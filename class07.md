## Tabels
#### used to represent information in a grid format, that's grid allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes.

### ***Basic Table Structure:***
* 'table' element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.
* 'tr' you indicate the start of each row using the opening 'tr' tag, at the end of the row you use a closing '/tr' tag.
* 'td': to represent the heading for either a column or a row. 
##### Each cell of a table is represented using a 'td' element, at the end of each cell you use a closing '/td' tag.


* You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
* For long tables you can split the table into a 'thead', 'tbody', and 'tfoot'.


### function object
*  object is an instance of the class which have all the properties of that class. is any type that implements operator(). This operator is referred to as the call operator or sometimes the application operator.
*  Function objects provide two main advantages over a straight function call. The first is that a function object can contain state.

### Method:
* A method is a function associated with an object, or, put differently, a method is a property of an object that is a function. 
* Methods are defined the way normal functions are defined, except that they have to be assigned as the property of an object.
