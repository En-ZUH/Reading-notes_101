#### CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It lets you lay content out in rows and columns, and has many features that make building complex layouts straightforward. 
#### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a:
* Block-level elements start on a new line
   * Examples include: 'h1, p, ul, li'
* Inline elements flow in between surrounding text
   * Examples include: 'img, b, i'

### floating element :
#### The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.
#### floating property can have one of the following values:
   * left: The element floats to the left of its container.
   * right: The element floats to the right of its container.
   * none: The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default.
   * inherit: The element inherits the float value of its parent.
   
#### Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
#### CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
#### You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
