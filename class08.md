## What is a Form?!

## HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to your site
#### form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

#### Making Choices:
* Radio buttons for use when a user must select one of a number of options.

* Checkboxes when a user can select and unselect one or more options.

* Drop-down boxes when a user must pick one of a number of options from a list

#### Submitting Forms:
* Submit buttons to submit data from your form to another web page.
* Image buttons similar to submit buttons but they allow you to use an image.
#### Uploading Files:
* File upload allows users to upload files (e.g. images) to a website.

#### Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

#### Each form control is given a name, and the text the  user types in or the values of the options they select  are sent to the server.

#### HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it  easier for visitors to fill in forms


## Lists, Tables and Forms
There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types of HTML elements, such as lists, tables, and forms
#### list-style-type : The list-style-type property allows you to control the shape or style
 of a bullet point .
* Unordered Lists
* Ordered Lists 
#### Images for Bullets
You can  specify an image to act as a bullet point using the list-style-image property.
#### Positioning the Marker
Lists are indented into the page by default and the list-styleposition property indicates whether the marker should appear on  the inside or the outside of the box containing the main points.
#### List shorthand
As with several of the other CSS properties, there is a property that acts as a shorthand for list styles. It is called list-style, and it allows you to express the markersâ€™ style, image and position properties in any order.
Tables properties
You  have already met several properties that are commonly used with tables. Here we will put them together in a single example using the following:
* width.
* padding.
* text-trasform.
* letter-spacing, fornt size.
* border-top, border-bottom.
* text-align.
* background-color.
